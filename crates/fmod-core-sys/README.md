Raw bindings to [FMOD Core](https://fmod.com/core). These are the raw bindings â€”
you probably want [FMOD.rs](https://lib.rs/fmod-rs) instead.

## Versioning

The bindings crate has its version derived directly from the FMOD library
version, for easier pinning of a specific header version. To be specific, for
a given FMOD version `aaaa.bb.cc` (`aaaa` = product version, `bb` = major
version, `cc` = minor version), the bindings crate is released as version
`aaaa.bb.BUILD+aaaa.bb.cc-BUILD`, where `BUILD` is the specific build version.
The build version is used in the bindings crate version to provide some padding
for if the bindings have an issue and need to be updated, as unlikely as that
may be.

In application use, it is recommended to pin a specific version of this crate.
FMOD checks that the header version matches the dynamic library version, so if
a version mismatch occurs, FMOD will fail to initialize.

If you need an older header version, open an issue.

The currently vendored headers are for FMOD Engine 2.02.05 (build 124257).

## Linking

We add `lib/{arch}` to the search path, and link `fmodL` for development builds,
`fmod` for release builds. The dynamic library is implicitly loaded from the run
directory, or you can load it explicitly.

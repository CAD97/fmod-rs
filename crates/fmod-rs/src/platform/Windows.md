  ## Windows Specific Starter Guide

 ### SDK Version

 FMOD is compiled using the following tools.

  - **Visual Studio 2019** - version 16.11.0 targeting platform toolset v142.
 
 ### Compatibility

 FMOD supports the below architectures back to Windows 7.

  - **x86** - optimized with SSE3.
 - **x64** - optimized with SSE3 (and AVX if detected at runtime).
 
 ### Libraries

 *The provided libs are import libraries which require the corresponding DLL to be present at runtime. Substitute $ARCH your desired architecture from the 'Compatibility' list above.*

 The C API of the supplied libraries are compatible with MinGW (C++ ABI not supported). The 64 bit dll can be linked directly. You will need to use the import library libfmod.a and libfmodstudio.a in order to link the 32 bit dlls.

 If you encounter issues linking fmod with MinGW, ensure that you are following the GCC linker ordering requirements and the MinGW library search order.

 #### FMOD Core Engine library

  - **/api/core/lib/$ARCH/fmod_vc.lib** - Release binary for production code (requires fmod.dll at runtime).
 - **/api/core/lib/$ARCH/fmodL_vc.lib** - Release binary with logging enabled for development (requires fmodL.dll at runtime).
 
 #### FMOD Studio Engine library (used in conjunction with core library)

  - **/api/studio/lib/$ARCH/fmodstudio_vc.lib** - Release binary for production code (requires fmodstudio.dll at runtime).
 - **/api/studio/lib/$ARCH/fmodstudioL_vc.lib** - Release binary with logging enabled for development (requires fmodstudioL.dll at runtime).

The conventional FMOD API installation path is
<code>%ProgramFiles(x86)%\FMOD&nbsp;SoundSystem\FMOD&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;API&nbsp;Windows</code>
and FMOD.rs will add the lib directories within to the link lib search path if
the <code>link-search</code> feature is enabled.

FMOD.rs links the logging library in development mode builds and the production
library in release mode builds.

### COM

 Before calling any FMOD functions it is important to ensure COM is initialized. You can achieve this by calling `CoInitializeEx(nullptr, COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED)` on each thread that will interact with the FMOD API. This is balanced with a call to `CoUninitialize()` when you are completely finished with all calls to FMOD.

 If you fail to initialize COM, FMOD will perform this on-demand for you issuing a warning. FMOD will not uninitialize COM in this case so it will be considered a memory leak.

 
<div class="item-info"><div class="stab" style="white-space:normal;font-size:inherit">
<span class="emoji">ðŸ¦€</span><span>
FMOD.rs does not handle COM initialization specially (it relies on the above
on-demand initialization done by the FMOD Engine), so if you want to silence
this warning, you will need to initialize COM yourself.
</span></div></div>

To ensure correct behavior FMOD assumes when using the WASAPI output mode (default for Windows Vista and newer) that you call [`System::get_num_drivers`](System::get_num_drivers), [`System::get_driver_info`](System::get_driver_info) and [`System::init`](System::init) from your UI thread. This ensures that any platform specific dialogs that need to be presented can do so. This recommendation comes from the [IAudioClient](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370865.aspx>) interface docs on MSDN which state:

  > In Windows 8, the first use of IAudioClient to access the audio device should be on the STA thread. Calls from an MTA thread may result in undefined behavior.
> 
 
 
<div class="item-info"><div class="stab" style="white-space:normal;font-size:inherit">
<span class="emoji">ðŸ¦€</span><span>
FMOD.rs does not attempt to restrict the first use of these functions to the UI
thread. This is a concession to cross-platform usability rather than a niche
theoretical concern on an out-of-mainstream-support Windows.
</span></div></div>

#### ASIO and C#

 If using [`FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_ASIO`](FMOD_OUTPUTTYPE_ASIO) with the C# wrapper, FMOD will need to be running on the STA thread to ensure COM is intialized correctly. This can be achieved by adding the [STAThreadAttribute](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.stathreadattribute?view=net-6.0>) to the main method:

``````````csharp
[STAThread]
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Factory.System::new(out FMOD.System system);
    system.set_output(OUTPUTTYPE.ASIO);
    system.init(32, INITFLAGS.NORMAL, IntPtr.Zero);
}
``````````

 ### Thread Affinity

 All threads will default to [`ThreadAffinity::CoreAll`](ThreadAffinity::CoreAll), this is recommended due to the wide variety of PC hardware but can be customized with [`raw::FMOD_Thread_SetAttributes`](raw::FMOD_Thread_SetAttributes).

 ### Thread Priority

 The relationship between FMOD platform agnostic thread priority and the platform specific values is as follows:

  - [`ThreadPriority::Low`](ThreadPriority::Low) ~ THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL
 - [`ThreadPriority::Medium`](ThreadPriority::Medium) ~ THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL
 - [`ThreadPriority::High`](ThreadPriority::High) ~ THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL
 - [`ThreadPriority::VeryHigh`](ThreadPriority::VeryHigh) ~ THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST
 - [`ThreadPriority::Extreme`](ThreadPriority::Extreme) ~ THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL
 - [`ThreadPriority::Critical`](ThreadPriority::Critical) ~ THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL
 
 ## Performance Reference

 This section is a companion for the [CPU Performance](<https://fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/white-papers-cpu-performance.html>) white paper and serves as a quick reference of facts targeting this platform.

 ### Format Choice

 Each compression format provided in FMOD has a reason for being included, the below list will detail our recommendations for this platform. Formats listed as primary are considering the best choice, secondary formats should only be considered if the primary doesn't satisfy your requirements.

  - **Vorbis**: Primary format for all sounds.
 - **FADPCM**: Secondary format if Vorbis CPU usage is too high for low spec machines.
 - **PCM**: Not recommended.
 - **XMA**: Unavailable.
 - **AT9**: Unavailable.
 
 ### Channel Count

 To give developers an idea about the costs of a particular format we provide synthetic benchmark results. These results are based on simple usage of the FMOD Studio API using recommended configuration settings.

 #### Settings

  - **Real channel count:** 64
 - **Sample rate:** 48KHz
 - **Speaker mode:** Stereo
 - **DSP block size:** 1024 samples
 
 #### Test Device

  - **CPU:** Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 860 @ 2.80GHz
 - **OS:** Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7601]
 
 #### Results

  - **DSP with Vorbis:** 6.88% (+/- 0.52%)
 - **DSP with FADPCM:** 3.10% (+/- 0.20%)
 - **DSP with PCM:** 1.59% (+/- 0.24%)
 - **Update at 60 FPS:** 0.82% (+/- 0.05%)
